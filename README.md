# trimesh2
This is a fork of the trimesh2 library (originally by [Szymon Rusinkiewicz](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~smr/)), which I use a lot in my other graphics projects. I'm staying close to the original, and adding my fixes for MSVC compilation.

 * For the Trimesh2 project, see [the original Trimesh2 homepage](http://gfx.cs.princeton.edu/proj/trimesh2/).
 * Original MSVC 2012 project by Bengt Rosenberger.

Notable changes/additions to vanilla trimesh2
 * MSVC project for Visual Studio 2013 professional
 * Added I/O support for smf format
